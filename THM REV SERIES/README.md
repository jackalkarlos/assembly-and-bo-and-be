## Base 10:
```We mortal humans use the decimal (base 10) system.
Base 10 includes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9.
Here is 243 in base 10:
243 = (102 * 2) + (101 * 4) + (100 * 3) = 200 + 40 + 3.```

If decimal is denoted, it will usually be with the suffix of "d" such as 12d.

## Base 7:
```We can apply this to any base. For example, 243 in base 7:
243(in base 7) = (72 * 2) + (71 * 4) + (70 * 3) = 98 + 28 + 3 = 129(in decimal).

Base 7 includes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6.
9 isn't in base 7, so how do we represent it in base 7?
9(in decimal) = (71 * 1) + (70 * 2) = 7 + 2. Our answer is going to be 12(base7) = 9(base10).```

## Base 2:
```What about base 2? Base 2 includes 0 and 1. It works the same as the others. Here are some good values to know:
210 = 1024, 29 = 512, 28 = 256, 27 = 128, etc.```
